        <h1>Kydykbekova Aidai COMSE-23</h1>
        <p class = "small-p">I am 18  years old, I have a big family. I am the oldest child.
             I love cooking, really like watching dorams and anime.   In 2023 i started to learn programming, and i really love it, but I didn't choose what I like more fronted or backend.   </p>
             <img src="img/photo_2023-10-13 18.39.56.jpeg" alt="my foto" />
        <p>I also really like helping animals. I have always treated them with kindness and compassion. I have never offended stray dogs and cats, I tried to feed and pet them. There are several animal shelters in our city â€” my sister, my friends and I often visit them: we help with cleaning the aviaries, bring food for the tailed ones, walk them, stroke them.</p>
        

        <p>There are my favorite dorama:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>A magical battle</li>
                <li>The fairy of weightlifting</li>
                <li>Talker</li>
                <li>Happiness</li>
            </ul>
